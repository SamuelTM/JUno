# JUno

JUno is a Java based Uno simulator which can be run using the command line (for the moment). It also implements [Mikael
Fridenfalk's NMax and Hypermax algorithms](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A761634&dswid=-7757)
to find the best move for the first player (player 0).

This project was part of my and my friend's [sergio02195](https://github.com/sergio02195) term paper.
